The InvoiceXpress Extension for WooCommerce allows you to invoice your clients via InvoiceXpress (http://en.invoicexpress.com/) based on the orders you take on your WooCommerce store. When an order comes in the extension checks if the customer exists in your InvoiceXpress account and creates an invoice that can be e-mailed or archived.

Premium Support
The WidgiLabs team does not provide support for the WooCommerce-InvoiceXpress plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One on one email support is available to people who bought the [Premium One-Year Technical support](http://widgilabs.com/wordpress/plugins/woocommerce-invoicexpress/) only.
Buying gives you access to our support team. You can email us your questions about usage of the plugin or your problems in setting it up and we’ll assist you! We’ll help you set up the plugin on your site if something is not working and we’ll give you advice on specific settings you have questions about so it might be well worth your investment!

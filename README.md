The InvoiceXpress Extension for WooCommerce allows you to invoice your clients via InvoiceXpress (http://en.invoicexpress.com/) based on the orders you take on your WooCommerce store. When an order comes in the extension checks if the customer exists in your InvoiceXpress account and creates an invoice that can be e-mailed or archived.
